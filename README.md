# Hate-Speech-Detection
This project is  a machine learning model for detecting hate speech in text. The model uses a combination of natural language processing techniques and machine learning algorithms to analyze text and determine if it contains hate speech. The model is trained on a dataset of labeled text (e.g. negative speech or positive speech or neutral speech) and then used to classify new text.
The code uses the pandas library to read a CSV file containing labeled text, and then uses the sklearn library to train a model using the Naive Bayes algorithm. The performance of the model is evaluated using the accuracy metric, which is a value between 0 and 1 representing the percentage of test examples that the model correctly classified as negative( hate speech) or positive(non-hate speech).The code also takes input from the user in the form of text, and then predicts the label of the text whether it is negative(hate speech) or positive(non-hate speech).
The goal of this code is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately identify hate speech in text, which can be useful for a variety of applications such as social media monitoring and content moderation.
